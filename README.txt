I do not take ownership of any of these txts, merely using them and having 
backups here.

Please recommend me more adlists in the issues section! :)



If you are using pi-hole with these lists, to use them go to the admin panel, login, Group Management, Adlists 
then whilst inside of the configured section, at the top add the first url
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CleanMachine1/AdlistTXTS/main/adservers.txt
and press done then add the other 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CleanMachine1/AdlistTXTS/main/hosts

Once you have added both go to tools, Update Gravity, then press update

Also although its not here I recommend having another list
