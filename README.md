I do not take ownership of any of these txts, merely using them and having 
backups here.

Please recommend me more adlists in the issues section!

### What this does

This is a compilation of 3 different blacklist adlists, they are the following:

https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
<br>
https://github.com/anudeepND/blacklist
<br>
https://dbl.oisd.nl/
<br>
This combination is a very extreme blacklist due to it being normally over 1.2M blocks

### How to use 

Go to your admin panel, go to group management, Adlist and add the following address
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CleanMachine1/AdlistTXTS/main/list.txt
then save it
then finally refresh your gravity (tools, update gravity)
